# suvit-notification
Push notification API.

## Overview

This project implements a robust and scalable notification service capable of sending notifications via multiple channels (email, SMS, and push notifications). It's designed to handle high volumes of notifications efficiently and reliably.

## Architecture and Design Decisions

### 1. Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Queue System**: Bull.js (backed by Redis)
- **Admin Panel**: Next.js

We chose this stack for its scalability, performance, and developer-friendly ecosystem.

### 2. Key Components

#### a. API Layer
- RESTful endpoints for creating and managing notifications
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Input validation and error handling

#### b. Database (MongoDB)
- Stores notification details, status, and retry information
- Indexed for efficient querying and filtering

#### c. Queue System (Bull.js with Redis)
- Manages asynchronous processing of notifications
- Handles retries with exponential backoff
- Supports scheduled notifications

#### d. Notification Processors
- Separate services for email, SMS, and push notifications
- Easily extendable for new notification channels

#### e. Admin Panel
- Next.js-based dashboard for monitoring and managing notifications
- Real-time updates using server-side rendering and API polling

### 3. Key Features

#### Scalability
- Asynchronous processing allows for high throughput
- Horizontal scaling possible for both API and worker processes

#### Reliability
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed notifications
- Persistent queue ensures no notifications are lost, even if the service restarts

#### Flexibility
- Support for multiple notification channels
- Scheduled notifications for future delivery

#### Monitoring and Management
- Admin panel for real-time monitoring and management of notifications
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing

### 4. Deployment

The project is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment and scaling. The docker-compose setup includes:
- Main application container
- MongoDB container
- Redis container
- Admin panel container

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file
3. Run `docker-compose up --build`

The main API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and the admin panel at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Add more detailed analytics and reporting features
- Integrate with more notification channels (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams)
- Implement A/B testing for notification content and timing

## Conclusion

This notification service is designed to be scalable, reliable, and easily extendable. By leveraging asynchronous processing and a robust tech stack, it can handle high volumes of notifications across multiple channels efficiently.
